Datacasting Feed Generation Tools

The main objective of the project is to develop a reusable software suite that generates DatacastingRSS 
feeds for various datasets to drive the Datacasting Feed Reader and the Datacasting Event Portal. 
DatacastingRSS extends Really Simple Syndication (RSS) to deliver regularly changing Earth science data content. 
Of specific interest for this project, near real-time Earth science data granules are discovered via multiple web services, such as ECHO and PO.DAAC OpenSearch. 
The metadata of newly discovered data granules are extracted and repacked according to the DatacastingRSS standard format. 
The DatacastingRSS Feed Generation Tools facilitate the metadata extraction and repacking process 
via five data processing stages: requesting data, parsing response, gathering metadata, ingesting metadata and generating DatacastingRSS feeds. 
With the new DatacastingRSS feeds providing backend support to the Feed Reader and the Event Portal, a wealth of Earth science data is available at anyoneâ€™s fingertips. 
For example, a first responder to a catastrophic event is able to see data and information 
available at the current time so that he/she can decide how best to respond 
and an Earth observing scientist is able to download all available data for an event for further analysis.
